# Introduction
This repository contains a set of programs that are part of a Master's program at Elisava called the "Master in Data and Design". The program is designed to gather and save data from various sensors in order to study air quality and other environmental factors. The main program, Madd_2022.ino, reads data from PM25 and SCD41 sensors at specified intervals, as well as the current date and time from a clock module. The gathered data is then saved in a data.csv file. The other programs in this repository work in conjunction with the main program to provide a comprehensive data collection system. In the following sections, we will provide a detailed description of each program and their functions.

# Overview
This repository contains 5 programs that work together to gather and save data from various sensors. The main program, Madd_2022.ino, reads data from PM25 and SCD41 sensors at specified intervals, as well as the current date and time from a clock module. The gathered data is then saved in a data.csv file.

# Programs
## ClockSetup.ino
This program allows for the setting and displaying of the current time on the clock module.

## PM25_Funciona.ino
This program reads values for particulate matter in the air, specifically 2.5, 5, and 10 microns.

## SCD41.ino
This program reads values for CO2, temperature, and humidity in the air.

## SD_Card_WemosD1.ino
This program is responsible for saving and reading data to and from an SD card.

# Conclusion
All of these programs work together to provide a comprehensive data collection system for air quality and other environmental factors. The data can be easily accessed and analyzed through the data.csv file generated by Madd_2022.ino.
