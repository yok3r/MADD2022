# MADD2022

# Overview
This repository contains 5 programs that work together to gather and save data from various sensors. The main program, Madd_2022.ino, reads data from PM25 and SCD41 sensors at specified intervals, as well as the current date and time from a clock module. The gathered data is then saved in a data.csv file.

# Programs
## ClockSetup.ino
This program allows for the setting and displaying of the current time on the clock module.

## PM25_Funciona.ino
This program reads values for particulate matter in the air, specifically 2.5, 5, and 10 microns.

## SCD41.ino
This program reads values for CO2, temperature, and humidity in the air.

## SD_Card_WemosD1.ino
This program is responsible for saving and reading data to and from an SD card.

# Conclusion
All of these programs work together to provide a comprehensive data collection system for air quality and other environmental factors. The data can be easily accessed and analyzed through the data.csv file generated by Madd_2022.ino.
